🌿 CalmNotes – Product Plan
1️⃣ Core Vision

CalmNotes is an AI-assisted session documentation tool for therapists.

The goal is not “AI therapy.”

The goal is:

Reduce therapist burnout by automating high-quality, structured, compliant session notes.

Long-term positioning:

A calm, secure AI co-pilot for clinical documentation.

Built for sustainability, privacy, and clinical credibility.

🎯 Problem It Solves

Therapists:

Spend 1–3 hours daily writing notes

Experience burnout due to admin load

Struggle with consistency in SOAP / DAP / BIRP formats

Need compliant documentation for insurance & audits

Pain point:
Documentation is repetitive but must remain precise.

🧱 Phase 1 – MVP (Foundation)
Core Feature Set
1. Session Input

Therapist enters:

Raw session notes (bullet or paragraph)

Or uploads transcript

Optional:

Client name (masked internally)

Session type

Risk flags

2. AI Note Generation

Generate structured formats:

SOAP

DAP

BIRP

Output includes:

Clinical tone

Objective language

Risk notes if present

No hallucinated diagnoses

3. Editable Output

Therapist can edit AI note

Version history tracking

Manual override always allowed

4. Secure Storage

Encrypted storage

Row-level security

User-scoped access

No public access (unlike current Appwrite setting)

5. Export Options

Copy to clipboard

Download as:

PDF

DOCX

Plain text

🛡 Privacy & Compliance Strategy

This is where CalmNotes becomes serious.

Immediate Intentions

All AI calls go through server-side proxy

No PHI stored in logs

Encryption at rest

Environment variables fully isolated

No client-exposed API keys

Future Intention: HIPAA-Ready Architecture

If product evolves:

Move from Appwrite → HIPAA-compliant backend

BAA with AI provider

Audit logging

Role-based access control

Multi-clinician organization accounts

🧠 Phase 2 – Intelligence Layer

Once MVP works reliably:

1. Clinical Safeguards

Detect suicidal ideation

Flag high-risk language

Suggest safety plan template

2. Memory Layer

Client longitudinal summaries

AI recalls past sessions contextually

Therapist-controlled context window

3. Structured Data Extraction

Automatically extract:

Mood trends

Goals progress

Treatment plan alignment

🏗 Phase 3 – Product Maturity
Multi-Tenant Architecture

Practice-level accounts

Multiple clinicians under one org

Shared client records (permission-based)

Analytics Dashboard

Time saved per week

Session count

Documentation speed

Burnout risk indicator

Integrations

EHR export

Insurance submission format

Calendar sync

Voice-to-text session recording

🖥 Platform Strategy
Phase 1

Web app only

Focus on usability + speed

Phase 2

Desktop optimized

Possibly Electron wrapper

Mobile app not priority.

Therapists document from laptop.

💰 Monetization Strategy
Early Stage

Free beta for selected therapists

Feedback-driven iteration

Later

Subscription model

Solo clinician plan

Group practice plan

Usage-based AI cost control

🧩 Technical Architecture Direction
Frontend

Next.js

TypeScript

Proper error boundaries

Clean separation of UI / AI logic

Backend

API routes

AI wrapper abstraction layer

Strict schema validation

Rate limiting

Database

Row-level security

User-based ownership

Soft deletes

🔥 What Makes CalmNotes Different

Not:

Another ChatGPT wrapper

But:

Structured, clinical output

Burnout-focused

Compliant-first architecture

Built for scale from day one

📈 Long-Term Vision (3–5 Years)

If executed properly:

CalmNotes becomes:

AI documentation assistant

Clinical intelligence tool

Burnout reduction platform

Eventually full EHR augmentation layer

🧭 Immediate Next 30-Day Plan

Build AI wrapper properly (server-side only)

Add structured output validation

Fix environment isolation

Lock down database permissions

Add logging & error boundaries

Polish UI

Add basic landing page

Deploy beta

🧠 Strategic Mindset

For Alicia (and any technical reviewer), what matters is:

Is it secure?

Is it scalable?

Is it maintainable?

Is it thoughtfully structured?

Or is it just a demo?

CalmNotes should clearly look like:

A product under construction — not a hackathon build.
